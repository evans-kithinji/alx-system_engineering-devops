12 (11-directories_permissions) The find command is used to search for files and directories within a specified directory and its subdirectories. The period (dot) represents the current directory. When find is used with . as the starting point, it will search for files and directories within the current directory and its subdirectories. -type d: This option tells find to only look for directories (folders). -exec: The -exec option allows you to execute a command on each file or directory that find locates. chmod a+x {} +: This is the command that find executes for each directory it finds. The curly braces {} are a placeholder that represents the path of each directory that find finds. When find locates a directory, it replaces {} with the actual path of that directory before executing the chmod command. +: The plus sign + acts as a delimiter that tells find to execute the chmod command with multiple arguments at once. This means that find will collect multiple directory paths and pass them as arguments to the chmod command, rather than running the chmod command for each directory separately.
